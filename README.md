GoJo_Afalagi is a simple web application built with front end (HTML, CSS, Js) and in backend (Python and Django) that allows users/renters to see and search houses and for house owners to post available homes to rent. Users can interact easily with house owners without the interrogation of brokers.

*Your house seeker for rent.*

## Architecure

### Backend

GoJo_Afalagi's backend is written primarily in Python. Python was used because as the backend language because it has a wide variety of easy web application frameworks like as Django. Django was used as the web framework to build a RESTful API because it is easy and flexible. 

For the database I used a MySQLite server because the relational database is most suited for structured data in this application.

### Frontend

For the front-end, I have used HTML and CSS and added Bootstrap additionally . Features like navigation bars and footers were directly sourced from Bootstrap. I chose Bootstrap to save some time and to make it look good within a short period of time.
