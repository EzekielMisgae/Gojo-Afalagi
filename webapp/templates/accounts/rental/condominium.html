    <h3>Condominium</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A condominium house, also known as a condo, is a type of housing that is
        individually owned and typically part of a larger complex or building. Condos are similar to apartments in that
        they are often located in urban areas and offer a variety of amenities such as swimming pools, fitness centers,
        and community rooms. However, unlike apartments, condos are owned by individual residents and offer the benefits
        of homeownership, such as the ability to customize the interior and make changes to the property. They also
        typically come with shared common areas and facilities like elevators, hallways and security systems that are
        managed and maintained by the condominium association. Condos are often a popular choice for people looking for
        a low-maintenance living option in a city or suburban area.</p>
