    <h3>Rooms</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A single room house is a compact and efficient living space that is designed for one person or a small family. It typically has a single room that serves as the living room, bedroom, and kitchen all in one. The room is usually divided into different areas to create a sense of separation between the different functions. The kitchen area may include a small stove and refrigerator, while the sleeping area may have a bed and storage space. A single room house may also have a separate bathroom and entrance, but it is often smaller than a traditional multi-room house. Despite its small size, a single room house is a functional and practical option for those looking for a simple and affordable living space.</p>
