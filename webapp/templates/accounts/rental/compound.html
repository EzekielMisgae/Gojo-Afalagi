    <h3>Compound</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A compound house is a type of residential property that is made up of multiple
        buildings within a single gated or fenced area. These houses are often found in upscale neighborhoods and are
        popular among families who want the privacy and security that a compound offers. The main house is usually the
        largest and most luxurious of the buildings, featuring amenities such as multiple bedrooms, bathrooms, living
        areas, and a kitchen. Additional buildings within the compound may include guest houses, staff quarters,
        garages, and storage sheds. The compound may also include outdoor spaces such as gardens, swimming pools, and
        sports courts. These houses are often designed in a specific architectural style, such as Mediterranean or
        Colonial, and are often built using high-quality materials. Compound houses offer a sense of privacy and
        exclusivity, and are often preferred by families who value security and privacy.</p>
